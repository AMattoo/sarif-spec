This directory contains sample output from the following tools in the SWAMP that produce code paths:

- `clang`
- `cppcheck`
- `findbugs`
- `spotbugs` (a fork (successor) or `findbugs`).

The locations in the result files are below and are all relative to `ToolSamples (the locations are also in the file tool_results_with_paths.txt). 
SpotBugs is a fork (successor) of FindBugs.  The commercial tools all have code paths, but our agreement with the commercial tool vendors prevents me from sharing output.
