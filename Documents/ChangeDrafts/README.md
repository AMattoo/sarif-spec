# ChangeDrafts folder

This folder contains versions of the specification that include individual proposed
changes to the current Working Draft.

When such a change is approved, the Editors merge it into the current provisional draft
(which, at certain times, the TC can choose to designate as the next Working Draft).

NOTE: This folder contains the proposals as they were presented to the TC.
Changes are often accepted "as amended", so the changes merged into the provisional draft
might not match the changes in the change draft.
