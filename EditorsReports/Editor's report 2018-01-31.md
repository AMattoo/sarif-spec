# Editor's report

Laurence J. Golding and Michael Fanning

Presented at TC Meeting #9, January 31, 2018

1. [Issue #77](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/77): "Retitle the provisional draft to 'v2'"

    The title of the specification is now Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) Version **2.0**, and the provisional draft document is renamed accordingly.

    This avoids breaking Microsoft compilers and other tools which already produce and consumer SARIF v1.0.0.

2. After being approved at the last TC meeting (#8), the spec changes for the following issues were merged into the provisional draft:

    1. Issue [#33](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33): "Should we allow formatting in messages?"

    2. Issue [#61](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/61): "Consider specifying a format for links embedded in our plain text messages."

    3. Issue [#69](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/69): "Consider providing a physicalLocation on a stackFrame"

    4. Issue [#72](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/72): "run.lang property needs a default value"

    5. A small set of clarifications, editorial changes, and corrections of inaccuracies.

2. After being approved as within editorial discretion, the spec changes for the following issues were made in the provisional draft:

    1. Issue [#65](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/65): Ensure all syntax specifications are in EBNF
    
    2. Issue [#73](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/73): Alphabetize terms
