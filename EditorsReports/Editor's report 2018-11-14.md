# Editor's report

Laurence J. Golding and Michael Fanning

Presented at TC Meeting #27, November 14th, 2018

1. After being approved as amended at the last TC meeting (#26), the following spec changes were merged into the provisional draft:

    1. [Issue #118](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/118): "SARIF file naming convention"

    1. [Issue #183](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/183): "Consider providing a mechanism to escape forward slashes in hierarchical strings"

        The grammar already prohibited forward slashes. I just added a NOTE to call attention to that fact.

    1. [Issue #262](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/262): "Remove run.architecture"

    1. [Issue #263](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/263): "Clarify distinguishing presence or non-presence of logical and instance id components"

    1. [Issue #267](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/267): "Allow an external file to contain multiple properties".
