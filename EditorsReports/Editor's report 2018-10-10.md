# Editor's report

Laurence J. Golding and Michael Fanning

Presented at TC Meeting #25, October 10th, 2018

1. The following issues were closed without further action:

    1. [Issue #232](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/232): "We do not have an automationGuid to match automationLogicalId"

        I closed this as duplicate of [Issue #217](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/217): "Consider adding a discrete 'id' object,"
        because Michael and I decided to address this inconsistency by introducing the "id" object he'd previously proposed.

1. After being approved as amended at the last TC meeting (#23), the following spec changes were merged into the provisional draft:

    1. [Issue #234](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/234): "Consider making originalUriBaseIds a dictionary of file location objects"

    1. [Issue #242](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/242): "Rename startTime/endTime to startTimeUtc and endTimeUtc"

    1. [Issue #251](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/251): "We don't need a hash object"

1. I made the following changes at editorial discretion:

    1. [Issue #231](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/231): "Section on external files should go ahead and list all the properties that are externalizable"

        I made this change as part of [#235](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/235).
