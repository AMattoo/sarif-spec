1. I made the following changes at editorial discretion:

    1. Fix up the remaining places where I said "the B object in which A occurs" instead of my preferred formulation, "the A object's containing B object".

    1. Introduced the concept of "baseline run" ("baseline") already existed and used it to describe both `file.roles` and `result.baselineState`.
