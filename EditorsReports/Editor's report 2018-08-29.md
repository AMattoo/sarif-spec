# Editor's report

Laurence J. Golding and Michael Fanning

Presented at TC Meeting #22, August 29th, 2018

1. We closed the following issues:

    1. [Issue #70](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/70): "Document recommendations for serialization order"

        We opened this item because we wanted to optimize access to the information in the file. We're now going to address that by deconstructing the log file ([Issue #210](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/210)).

    1. [Issue #207](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/207): "Support tool plug-ins"

        This was a duplicate of [Issue #179](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/179): "Consider whether SARIF covers plug-ins/rules versioning sufficiently".

1. The formal spec language for the following issues was made available for review on the specified dates, and we will move their adoption in today's meeting:

    1. [Issue #216](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/216): "Remove result.ruleMessageId"
